# PM Feedback - ReallySick Agency & Monitoring

## Description

Draft personal feedback message for the PM at ReallySick about being more proactive in monitoring chat and handling client questions. This will be sent via WhatsApp/Discord - should be personal and concise.

**Goal**: PM understands their scope and when to escalate vs. handle independently.

## Key Points to Cover

**What PM should handle:**
- Client updates (engineers provide dates agreed with PM)
- Simple questions where answers already exist
- Monitoring chat more closely for team questions

**What I handle:**
- New/complex questions that don't have existing answers
- Product planning and direction

**When PM needs help:**
- If things feel hard → likely lacking knowledge → schedule knowledge transfer with me
- All answers should be at their fingertips

## Draft Message (WhatsApp/Discord)

Hey [PM name],

Quick feedback after reading the team memo:

I need you monitoring chat more closely. When engineers or clients ask questions, most of the time you should already have the answer.

**Your scope:**
- Client updates (get dates from engineers, share with clients)
- Simple questions (info that already exists)
- If answer doesn't exist, I'll handle it

**When things feel hard:**
That usually means you're missing context. Let's sit down and I'll transfer the knowledge. Schedule time with me.

**Bottom line:** Product planning stays with me. Your job is execution clarity - making sure everyone has what they need to ship.

Let me know if you have questions.

## Notes

- Keep it personal and direct (WhatsApp/Discord message, not formal)
- Emphasize this helps them, not just criticizing
- Offer knowledge transfer as support, not as criticism
- PM doesn't need to do much beyond execution clarity - most client interactions are predictable
