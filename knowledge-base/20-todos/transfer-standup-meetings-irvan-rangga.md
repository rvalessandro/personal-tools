# Transfer standup meetings to Irvan and Rangga

## Description

Delegate standup meeting responsibilities to [[40-contacts/irvan|Irvan]] and [[40-contacts/rangga|Rangga]], the tech leads at Laku6. This allows them to own team communication while freeing up your time for higher-level work.

**Goal**: Irvan and Rangga independently run standup meetings without your attendance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Meet with Irvan and Rangga to explain the transition (~15m)
  - Why: Delegation empowers tech leads, frees your time for strategic work
  - What: They'll run standups, escalate blockers to you
  - How: Share standup format, expectations, escalation criteria
- [ ] Share standup documentation/format with them (~5m)
- [ ] Have them co-run next standup with you observing (~10m)
- [ ] Full handoff - they run it independently

## Context & Resources

**Delegation best practices:**
- Matt Mochary: "Give away your Legos" - delegate to grow your team
- Will Larson: "Create space for growth" - tech leads need opportunities to lead
- Camille Fournier: "The Manager's Path" - delegation as leadership development

**What they should escalate:**
- Blockers that need your involvement (budget, cross-team dependencies)
- Team issues requiring leadership intervention
- Strategic decisions outside their scope

**What they should handle:**
- Daily status updates
- Technical blockers within the team
- Sprint planning and execution

## Notes

- This aligns with your leadership model: empower tech leads to own execution
- Standup meetings are execution-level - perfect for delegation
- You stay involved through escalations, not routine meetings
- Irvan and Rangga gain leadership experience
