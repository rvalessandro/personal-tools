# Offboard Eunike from SeeDr and transition to Lauren

## Description

Offboard [[40-contacts/eunike|Eunike]] from SeeDr project (resigned Dec 2025) and ensure smooth transition to [[40-contacts/lauren|Lauren]]. Also add [[40-contacts/louisa|Louisa]] to the WhatsApp group.

**Goal**: Clean transition with SeeDr team aware of new PM structure.

## Tasks
- [ ] Communicate to SeeDr team that Lauren is taking over from Eunike (~5m)
- [ ] Remove Eunike from SeeDr WhatsApp group (~2m)
- [ ] Add Louisa to SeeDr WhatsApp group (~2m)
- [ ] Ensure Lauren has access to all SeeDr resources (Linear, docs, repos) (~10m)
- [ ] Brief Lauren on current SeeDr priorities and context (~10m)

## Context & Resources

**People involved:**
- [[40-contacts/eunike|Eunike]] - outgoing PM (resigned Dec 2025)
- [[40-contacts/lauren|Lauren]] - incoming PM taking over SeeDr
- [[40-contacts/louisa|Louisa]] - additional PM being added to WhatsApp group

**Communication:**
- All contacts via WhatsApp
- Systeric PMs

**Why this matters:**
- Clean offboarding prevents knowledge loss
- SeeDr team needs clarity on who to work with
- Lauren needs to be unblocked immediately

## Notes

- Eunike resigned in December 2025, so this is time-sensitive
- Make it clear to SeeDr team who the new point of contact is
- Ensure no disruption to ongoing work
