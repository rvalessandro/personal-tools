# Share Systeric portal login for all Systeric engineers

## Description

Share the Systeric portal login credentials with all Systeric engineers to ensure everyone has access to internal tools and systems.

**Goal**: All Systeric engineers have portal access credentials.

## Tasks
- [ ] Compile list of Systeric engineers who need access (~2m)
- [ ] Prepare portal login credentials securely (~3m)
- [ ] Share credentials via secure channel (1Password, encrypted email, or team password manager) (~5m)
- [ ] Verify all engineers received and can access portal (~5m)

## Context & Resources

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures team has access to internal tools
- Unblocks engineers who may need portal access for work
- Standard onboarding/access management task

**Security best practices:**
- Use secure credential sharing (1Password shared vault, encrypted channels)
- Don't share via plain text email or Slack
- Consider individual accounts if portal supports it (better than shared login)

**Systeric team context:**
- Category 1: Systeric general task
- Quick coordination task, should be straightforward

## Notes

- If portal supports individual accounts, consider creating those instead of sharing one login
- Document who has access for future reference
- Update onboarding docs if this is a recurring need
