## Draft Message

```
Hi team @seedr 👋

Follow-up dari memo sebelumnya tentang timelines - we have two new memos to share:

**1. Daily Standup Reports**
https://linear.app/see-dr-pte-ltd/document/team-memo-daily-standup-reports-43cc65116e94

Setiap pagi, automated report akan di-post ke Discord dengan:
• Commits & tickets yang shipped (with links)
• What you're working on
• Recommended actions

**The 3-Day Rule:** Kalau ticket ga gerak 3+ hari, it gets flagged. Bukan punishment - it's a signal to check for blockers or break down the task.

**Simplified Async Standup:** Since Done & Working On are now automated, manual standup is just 2 lines:
@name - time
Blocked: [blocker + who + when needed]
Next: [commitment + deadline]

---

**2. Project Updates & Cycle Planning**
https://linear.app/see-dr-pte-ltd/document/team-memo-project-updates-and-cycle-planning-25bea93b8535

We're introducing **biweekly cycles** for predictable delivery:
• Planning meeting every 2 weeks (Monday morning, 30 min)
• First 10 min: engineers pick items from backlog to commit
• Cycle = batch commitment to management ("these items ship by Jan 17")

**First cycle**: Jan 6–17, 2026
**First planning meeting**: Monday Jan 6, 10:00 AM

---

**Keep Tickets Updated:** Both systems depend on accurate Linear data. PMs & Engineers - update ticket status as work progresses, don't wait for each other.

**Note:** For the first few days, some people might show "no work assigned" - that's because not all tasks are in Linear yet. Please make sure all work is ticketed and assigned by **Wednesday Jan 8**.

Tolong read through both memos, any questions just ask 🙏
