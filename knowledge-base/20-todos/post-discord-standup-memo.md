## Draft Message

```
Hi team @seedr 👋

Follow-up dari memo sebelumnya tentang timelines - sekarang kita punya automated daily standup: https://linear.app/see-dr-pte-ltd/document/team-memo-daily-standup-reports-43cc65116e94

Setiap pagi, report akan di-post ke Discord dengan:
• Commits & tickets yang shipped (with links)
• What you're working on
• Recommended actions

**The 3-Day Rule:**
Kalau ticket ga gerak 3+ hari, it gets flagged. Bukan punishment - it's a signal:
• Blocked? Raise it, we'll help
• Milestone kegedean? Break it down
• Small PRs > Big PRs

**Keep Tickets Updated:**
The standup is only as good as our data. PMs & Engineers - update ticket status as work progresses, don't wait for each other. Monitor until completion.

**Simplified Async Standup:**
Since Done & Working On are now automated, manual standup is just 2 lines:
```
@name - time
Blocked: [blocker + who + when needed]
Next: [commitment + deadline]
```

**Note:** For the first few days, some people might show "no work assigned" - that's because not all tasks are in Linear yet. Please make sure all work is ticketed and assigned by **Wednesday Jan 8**.

Tolong read through the full memo, any questions just ask 🙏
```
