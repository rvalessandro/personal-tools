# Consolidate roadmap between sales and supply team for Laku6

## Description

Consolidate and align the roadmap between the sales team and supply team at Laku6. This involves reviewing both teams' priorities, identifying conflicts or dependencies, and creating a unified roadmap that both teams can work from.

**Goal**: Single consolidated roadmap that sales and supply teams are aligned on.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review sales team roadmap and priorities (~10m)
- [ ] Review supply team roadmap and priorities (~10m)
- [ ] Identify conflicts, dependencies, and alignment gaps (~5m)
- [ ] Create consolidated roadmap with clear timelines (~5m)

## Context & Resources

**Why this matters:**
- Sales and supply need to be aligned on delivery timelines
- Prevents overpromising to customers or undersupplying inventory
- Ensures engineering resources are allocated correctly

**Alignment best practices:**
- Stripe: "Write it down" - document the consolidated roadmap
- Shishir Mehrotra: Use a single source of truth for cross-functional alignment
- Will Larson: "Work on what matters" - prioritize based on customer impact and business value

## Notes

- Timeline is tight - need to get this done today
- Focus on quick alignment, not perfect planning
- Document decisions so both teams have clarity
