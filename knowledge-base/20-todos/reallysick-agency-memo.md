# Draft ReallySick Team Memo on Agency & Clarity

## Description

Draft a one-page team memo addressing lack of agency and clarity in the ReallySick workflow. PMs and engineers are relying on daily check-ins instead of operating with clear timelines and proactive communication. This creates unnecessary meetings and slows down the team.

**Goal**: Establish default workflows that reduce daily follow-ups and enable async collaboration.

## Tasks
- [ ] Draft one-page team memo (~1h 30m)
  - Problem: Current state of daily check-ins
  - Solution: Default workflow with clear timelines
  - Benefits: Less micromanagement, more trust
  - When meetings ARE valuable
- [ ] Draft separate PM feedback message (~30m)
  - Need for closer chat monitoring
  - Knowledge transfer gaps
  - Scope clarity (what PM owns vs. what I own)

## Context & Resources

**Current Problems:**
1. PMs not following up when it's their turn to test after engineers finish
2. Engineers not proactively giving timelines for PRs by default
3. Daily check-ins to get status instead of clear upfront commitments
4. Team has the knowledge (same calls, same docs) but not applying it

**Desired Workflow:**
- Engineer commits upfront: "PR ready Friday, staging tested Saturday"
- PM doesn't chase daily - only tests on committed date
- Everyone flags delays early when they sense timing will run longer
- No need for daily "where are we?" questions

**Meetings ARE Good For:**
- PM-Engineer sit-downs to discuss scope/timelines
- PM challenging: "Can we make this quicker?"
- Faster than async for these value-add discussions
- Engineer escalates to me if can't accommodate

**PM Scope (for separate feedback):**
- Monitor chat more closely
- Handle client updates (engineers provide dates agreed with PM)
- Answer simple/existing questions
- I handle: new questions, product planning, direction
- If things feel hard → knowledge transfer session with me

**References:**
- Matt Mochary: Manager-employee expectations (The Great CEO Within)
- Will Larson: "Work on what matters" (Staff Engineer)
- Amazon: "Bias for Action" leadership principle
- GitLab: Handbook-first culture for async clarity

## Notes

- We've already done the knowledge transfer (same calls, same docs)
- Problem is application, not knowledge
- Memo needs empathy - they need to understand I hear them and want to help
- Keep it concise, no weasel words, impactful
- Avoid routine meetings, preserve meetings for high-value discussions
- Current way is not working - this will make everyone's life easier
