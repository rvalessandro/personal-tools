# Setup old phone for car navigation and music

## Description

Configure old phone with internet connectivity to use as dedicated car device for maps and Spotify. This prevents draining the main phone's battery during drives.

**Goal**: Old phone ready to use in car for navigation and music streaming.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enable mobile hotspot on main phone OR get SIM card for old phone (~5m)
- [ ] Connect old phone to internet (hotspot or mobile data) (~5m)
- [ ] Install Google Maps / Waze (~5m)
- [ ] Install Spotify (~5m)
- [ ] Login to Spotify account (~2m)
- [ ] Test navigation and music playback (~5m)
- [ ] Get car phone mount if needed (~3m)

## Context & Resources

**Why this matters:**
- Preserves main phone battery for work/emergency use
- Dedicated device means less distraction (can't check work messages while driving)
- Old phone becomes useful instead of sitting unused

**Setup options:**
- Option 1: Use main phone's mobile hotspot (no extra cost)
- Option 2: Get cheap prepaid SIM for old phone (more independent)

## Notes

- Consider getting a car phone mount if you don't have one
- Set up offline maps in Google Maps for areas you frequently drive
- This supports your travel on Jan 14 - good to have set up before then
