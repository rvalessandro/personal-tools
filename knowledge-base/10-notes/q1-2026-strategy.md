**Primary Goal**: Exit Q1 as a completely different person — disciplined, generous, muscular, and walking closely with God.

## Daily Schedule (4 AM - 5 PM)

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 4:00-4:30 AM | Breakfast | High-protein, high-calorie |
| 4:30-5:30 AM | Bible reading | 1 hour, receive from God |
| 5:30-7:00 AM | Workout + shower | 1hr 15min exercise |
| 7:00-9:00 AM | Bible reading + journal | 2 hours, reflect insights |
| 9:00-11:00 AM | Deep work | No meetings |
| 11:00 AM-2:00 PM | Operations/meetings | Standups, collaboration |
| 2:00-3:00 PM | Lunch | |
| 3:00-3:30 PM | Break | |
| 3:30-5:00 PM | Execution | Code reviews, admin |
| 5:00 PM+ | Family/rest | Protected time |

## Time Block Guidelines

- **Deep Work**: 9:00-11:00 AM (No meetings)
- **Meetings/Collaboration**: 11:00 AM-2:00 PM
- **Execution/Admin**: 3:30-5:00 PM

## Weekly Workout Split

- **Monday**: Push (bench, overhead press, incline press, face pulls, push-ups)
- **Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday**: Swimming (30-40 min)
- **Thursday**: Pull (deadlift, single-arm rows, pull-ups, face pulls)
- **Saturday**: Legs + core (squats, Romanian deadlifts, planks, bird-dogs)
- **Sunday**: Swimming or rest

## Physical Targets (End of Q1)

- **Weight**: 67-70kg (from 60-65kg current)
- **Back Squat**: 62kg (from 30kg)
- **Deadlift**: 95kg (from 40kg)
- **Bench Press**: 47kg (from 25kg)
- **Plank hold**: 90 seconds
- **Pull-ups**: 10 consecutive
- **Push-ups**: 20 consecutive
- **500m swim**: Under 12 minutes

## Financial Targets

- **Tithe increase**: 6.4M to 8M IDR/month
- **Living expenses reduction**: 21.5M to 19.9M IDR/month
- **Offset**: Reduced discretionary spending

## Character/Relational Guidelines

**With women:**
- Group settings only
- No late-night texting
- Clear boundaries, no ambiguity
- Exit if feelings develop

**With others:**
- Weekly intentional generosity acts
- 20%+ tipping
- Carry cash for spontaneous giving
- Target: 12+ intentional acts of kindness per quarter

## Success Metrics (90 days)

- 90/90 days waking at 4 AM with Bible completed by 9 AM
- 90-day workout/swim streak (no zero days)
- 24 fasting days (Tuesday/Wednesday, after 4:30 AM breakfast)
- 60+ journal entries (5x/week minimum)
- Zero Instagram feed scrolling (DMs only)
- Screen time under 45 min/day average

## Phone & Screen Time Rules

- **Instagram**: DMs only, no feed scrolling
- **X (Twitter)**: Capped at 15 min/day
- **TikTok**: Deleted
- **YouTube**: 30 min/day max
- **Total screen time**: Under 45 min/day

## Physical Imbalances to Fix

1. **Neck stiffness**: Chin tucks (3x10 daily), face pulls at gym
2. **Left shoulder discomfort**: Single-arm dumbbell rows (left first)
3. **Lower back weakness**: Daily planks + bird-dogs, deadlifts

## Core Principles

1. Busyness ≠ closeness to God
2. Bible reading as daily spiritual nourishment
3. 4:00 AM wake time consistency (no variation)
4. Violent iteration on failing systems
5. Protect morning hours (4-9 AM) with no exceptions
6. Clear boundaries as kindness
