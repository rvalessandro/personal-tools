# Israel Trip - January 14-20, 2026

**Duration**: 7 days (Jan 14-20)
**Timezone**: GMT+2 (home timezone)
**Purpose**: Travel/personal

## Schedule Adjustments

### Suspended for This Week
- Normal 4 AM wake-up routine
- Structured workout split (gym access may vary)
- Fasting days (Tuesday/Wednesday)
- Strict daily time blocks

### Maintain (Non-Negotiables)
- Daily Bible reading & prayer (minimum 1 hour)
- Journal entries (capture travel insights)
- No Instagram feed scrolling
- Tithe commitment continues

## Workout Adaptations

**Hotel/No-Gym Options**:
- Bodyweight circuits: Push-ups, planks, bird-dogs, squats
- Morning walks/runs (30-40 min cardio substitute)
- Stretching & mobility work
- Goal: No zero days - minimum 20 minutes movement daily

**If Gym Access Available**:
- 3x full-body sessions (lighter weights, focus on form)
- Swimming if hotel has pool

## Work Schedule

**Laku6 Hours** (if working):
- Normal: 10 AM-4 PM GMT+7 = 5 AM-11 AM Israel time
- During trip: Flexible, communicate timezone clearly with team
- Deep work: Take advantage of being in same timezone for flexible scheduling

**Meeting Considerations**:
- You're in GMT+2 (same as normal Israel time)
- Indonesia team: GMT+7 (5 hours ahead)
- Communicate availability in advance

## Food/Nutrition

- High-protein focus maintained
- Adapt to local meal timing
- No strict calorie tracking, focus on quality protein sources
- Hydration priority (travel dehydration risk)

## Success Metrics for Travel Week

- [ ] 7/7 days Bible reading completed
- [ ] 7/7 journal entries
- [ ] 5+/7 days with intentional movement (bodyweight/walking)
- [ ] Zero Instagram scrolling maintained
- [ ] Screen time awareness (no strict limit during travel)
- [ ] 2+ acts of generosity to strangers

## Post-Trip Reset

**Jan 21** (back to routine):
- Resume 4 AM wake-up immediately
- Back to structured workout split
- Resume fasting Tuesday/Wednesday
- Full time block schedule restored

## Notes

- This is a planned deviation, not a break from Q1 goals
- Character/spiritual disciplines continue
- Physical training adapts but doesn't stop
- Grace for schedule flexibility, not laziness
