# Team Memo: Operating with Agency & Clarity

**To**: ReallySick Team
**From**: Raffi
**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Re**: How we work together

---

## The Problem

**Clients ask for updates. PMs don't know when things will ship. Engineers don't know what's expected.**

This creates a cascade of issues:
- PMs chase engineers daily for status because they have no committed timeline
- Engineers work without clear deadlines, so they don't prioritize urgency
- Clients get vague answers or delays in responses
- Everyone wastes time in check-ins that could be avoided

We've done the knowledge transfer with some of the team members for admin migration, we  have access to the docs, you've seen the examples. The knowledge is there. What's missing is applying it.

## What Good Looks Like

**Default workflow:**

1. **Engineer commits upfront**: "PR will be ready Friday, staging tested Saturday"
2. **PM knows the timeline**: Can answer client questions immediately
3. **Flag early**: If you sense you'll be late, say so immediately. Don't wait to be asked.

**Example in practice:**
- Monday: PM asks Engineer about feature X
- Engineer: "I'll have the PR ready by Friday EOD. You can test on staging Saturday morning."
- PM updates client: "Feature X will be ready for your review Saturday."
- Friday 3pm: Engineer realizes it'll take until Saturday morning: "Hey, PR will be ready Saturday 10am instead. You can test Saturday afternoon."
- Engineer updates PM immediately, PM updates client
- Saturday afternoon: PM tests, provides feedback

**That's it.** No daily check-ins. Clear commitments. Proactive updates when things change.

## Why This Matters

**For Engineers**: Clear expectations. Less interruption. More trust.

**For PMs**: Can answer clients immediately. Less chasing. More predictability.

**For the team**: Less routine meetings. More focus. Better collaboration.

**For clients**: Clear updates. Faster delivery. More confidence.

**For our goals**: Achieving great things requires this level of clarity and accountability. This is what being product engineers means - we own outcomes, not just tasks.

## Meetings: What They're For

We're keeping our **async daily standups** - those stay async.

**Sit-downs ARE for:**
- Scope discussions and brainstorming
- PM challenging Engineer: "Can we ship this faster?"
- Learning sessions and knowledge transfer
- Problem-solving together

**Sit-downs are NOT for:**
- Status checks (those should be async text updates)
- "Where are we?" questions (you should already know from the committed timeline)

## What I Need From You

**Everyone:**
- Commit to timelines upfront when you take on work
- Flag delays the moment you sense them, not when asked

**Engineers:**
- When you get a task, give a timeline: "PR ready X day, staging Y day"
- If that changes, update proactively
- You own the timeline and drive development from planning to release

**PMs:**
- When you get a timeline, trust it - don't check in daily
- Test when committed, not before
- Use sit-downs for scope discussions, not status checks
- You set direction and influence product thinking - help engineers see user, customer, and business perspectives they may overlook

## When I'm Blocking You

My priority is unblocking you and enabling the team.

**If I'm blocking you** - for example, your PR has been waiting for review for a whole day and it's damaging your progress - reach out on WhatsApp immediately. I'll get it done soonest.

**For everything else**: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/rvalessandro/20m

Calendar full? Skip the calendar and just message me on WhatsApp.

## Making This Stick

Starting this week:
- Engineers: Give timelines on every new task
- PMs: Trust those timelines (only follow up if date is missed)
- Everyone: Flag blockers early

Let's try this for two weeks.

**Bottom line**: Clear commitments upfront. Proactive updates when things change. Less routine meetings, more focused work.
