---

- [Pain points and symptoms]

## The Solution

**[One-liner describing the solution]**

[Explanation of the approach with tables/diagrams if helpful]

## [Detailed Sections]

**Everyone**:

---

**Bottom line**: [One-liner summary of the key takeaway]
```

## Tone & Style

- Direct and clear — no corporate fluff
- Bilingual OK (English/Indonesian mix for SeeDr team)
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include specific examples
- Frame changes positively (enable, not punish)
- Connect to existing memos/processes when relevant

## Existing Memos (for reference)

1. **Operating with Agency & Clarity** — Engineers give timelines, PMs trust them, everyone flags delays early
2. **Daily Standup Reports** — Automated daily reports, 3-day rule, simplified async standup
3. **Project Updates & Cycle Planning** — Biweekly cycles, planning meetings, automated cycle reports

## Process

1. Ask the user what the memo is about (or use provided arguments)
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - Who is the audience?
   - What's the current pain point?
   - What's the proposed solution?
   - Does this connect to existing memos?
3. Draft the memo following the format
4. Show draft and ask for approval/changes
5. If approved, create in Linear using `mcp__seedr-linear__create_document` with project "PM Docs"
6. Update the Team Memos Index document with the new memo
7. Share the memo URL

## Rules

- Keep "The Problem" and "Bottom line" to one line each
- Be specific — no vague language
- Include actionable guidance for each role
- Use real examples when possible
- Connect to existing processes/memos
- Don't post until user approves

Start by asking: "What do you need to communicate to the team?"
